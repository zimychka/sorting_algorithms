# Sorting Algorithms

ðŸ“š Sorting Algorithms Comparative Analysis
This project is a coursework dedicated to the comparative analysis of five popular sorting algorithms:

Insertion Sort

Bubble Sort

Quick Sort

Selection Sort

Heap Sort

Sorting algorithms play a crucial role in computer science and everyday data processing, enabling the organization of information for more efficient use. They are widely applied in search engines, databases, scientific computing, and industry. As data volumes grow, efficient and accurate sorting becomes increasingly important, demanding the use of optimal algorithms.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to analyze and compare the performance of the listed sorting algorithms under various array sizes. The analysis aims to determine which algorithm is most suitable in specific scenarios based on execution time.

ðŸ›  Implementation
All sorting algorithms are implemented in C++ using Visual Studio. The project measures the execution time of each algorithm on arrays of different sizes. The results are presented in the form of tables and graphs to provide a clear visualization of each algorithmâ€™s efficiency.

ðŸ“ˆ Outcome
Based on the collected data, conclusions are drawn about the most appropriate sorting algorithm to use depending on the size of the data. This insight is especially valuable when developing high-performance software systems.
